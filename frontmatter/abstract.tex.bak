This research aims to extend the work completed by the Mechatronics Lab at the University of Cape town. This research studied the use of subject borne cameras to analyse, model and estimate the kinematic motion of a cheetah tail. Computer vision has progressed significantly within the last few years and studying the motion of animals with subject borne cameras allow unconstrained environments.
