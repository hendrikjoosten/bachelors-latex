I would like to thank Dr Amir Patel for supervising this project, without whom this project would not have been possible. I would also like to thank Bradley Stocks for the foundational work he has done in this field.

I would like to thank my peers who have helped me through one of the most challenging endeavours of my life; obtaining an engineering degree. There have been numerous times where only through our combined efforts and support we could succeed.

Finally, I would like to thank my family who have supported and guided me through all of my life. Without your vision and belief I would not have been where I am today.
