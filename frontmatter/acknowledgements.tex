I would like to thank Dr Amir Patel for supervising this project, without whom this work would not have been possible. Also to Neil Steenkamp for helping me whenever I had questions. Lastly I would also like to thank Bradley Stocks for the foundational work he has done in this field and his efforts in documenting it. 

I would like to acknowledge my peers who have helped me through one of the most challenging endeavours of my life, obtaining an engineering degree. There have been numerous times where success would not have been possible without their help and support. 

Finally, I would like to thank my family who have supported and guided me through all of my life. My mother for her care, my father for his belief and my sister for her inspiration. Without your vision and faith I would not have been where I am today.
