Firstly, I would like to thank Dr. Amir Patel for supervising this project, without whom this work would not have been possible. Had it not been for his incredible insight and creative thinking the device designed may never have existed. Also, to Neil Steenkamp for helping me whenever I had questions and explaining difficult concepts in a simple and clear manner. Lastly, I would like to thank Bradley Stocks for the foundational work he has done in this field and his efforts in documenting it. His commitment and work ethic has helped and inspired me to take on such a complex topic.

I would like to acknowledge my peers who have helped me through one of the most challenging endeavours of my life: obtaining an engineering degree. There have been numerous times where success would not have been possible without their help and support. It has been a time of discovery for us, not only academically but in all aspects of life.

To the University of Cape Town and the Department of Electrical Engineering for the world class education provided to me by excellent faculty. Specifically to the Mechatronics Research Lab for developing its namesake program of study and providing an interesting and future orientated curriculum. 

I would like to thank my friends who have shown me the importance of perseverance and the value of courage. To Zach, Jaydon, Patrick, Dan, Conor, Dean, Mike, Alvin, James, Imran, and Luke thank you for the most amazing 4 years.

Finally, my family who have supported and guided me through all of my life. My mother for her care and compassion, my father for his belief and trust, and my sister for her inspiration. Without your vision and faith I would not have been where I am today.
