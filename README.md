Final research project writeup

Estimating, modeling and understanding bipedal movement using subject bourne cameras and sensors.

This allows for data capture in unconstrained environments, a shortcoming that has always plauged classical motion capture.

The idea of using subject bourne cameras was published by Dr. Amir Patel from the University of Cape Town in 2015. Bradley Stocks designed and implemented a prototype system.
