\section{Objectives of this study}

This research project aims to show that subject-borne sensors, primarily cameras and IMUs, can provide researchers in the field of biomechanics and bio-inspired robotics with extensive datasets to understand and model the seemingly magical natural world. 



\section{Scope and Limitations}
The research presented herein does not seek to push the boundaries of modern sensor technology, nor does it wish to re-imagine understood and accepted models of natural phenomena. Instead, a humble methodology is proposed that brings together systems from exciting disciplines of research 

It should therefore be understood that the following work
