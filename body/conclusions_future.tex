\subsection{Future work}
%%progression of computer vision
The system was originally designed with four cameras due to the availability

Originally there was an intention to reduce the amount of cameras

The iterative design process would have followed :
Initially using 4 cameras and an Smartphone as a sensor
Continuing to use a 2 cameras ( one at the back and one at the front)  and a smartphone as a sensor..

then using the smartphone camera at the front and a single camera at the back whilst uising the smartphone as a sensor

finally using only the smartphone at the fron as a single camera and sensor.


%%progression of image processing
The progression on the image processing:

initially use markers and use a semi-automatic toolbox to identify critical points on te image.

automate the image processing with markers

automate the image processing to work without markers.


These improvements would decrease the overall cost of the system greatly and optimize the the process substantially.
