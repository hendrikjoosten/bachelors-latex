\chapter{Methodology}
To ensure the success of this project a basic plan of action was created. The following diagram shows the critical phases of the project and their dependence on each other.

\section{System Design}
This section is dedicated to defining and understanding the specifications of the data capture system. The system will consist of 4 cameras and an IMU mounted to the torso of the subject. the cameras will record the legs of the subject while the IMU will log inertial data from the body of the subject.

Due to the availability of equipment provided by the Mechatronics Lab the following equipment was chosen as the main components to use in the system:
