\section{Introduction}
This research project brings together various disciplines of research to show

\section{New Perspectives from Animal Borne Cameras}
In large this researched project was inspired by work done in the Mechatronics Lab at the University of Cape Town. In 2017, Patel et al.  \cite{patel2017trackingieee} showed that using animal borne cameras and motion sensors the tail kinematics of the cheetah (Acinonyx Jubatus) could be tracked. This work was partly inspired by Kane et al.;\cite{kane2014falcons} where falcon borne cameras were used to better understand airborne pursuit.

\section{Using 3rd person vision}
The work done by \cite{chen2013survey} shows how good we are at understanding human motion
