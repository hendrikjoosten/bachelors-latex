\chapter{Results, Verification and Discussion}
This chapter is dedicated to discussing the results generated and their verification. 

\section{Results}
The project had various critical phases that were completed. The following phases and their results have been documented below.

\subsection{System Design Results}
The data capture ystem was designed to meet the specifications

pictured below is a subject wearing the data capture system.

The subject confirmed the comfort of the data capture system due to the 

\subsection{Model Results}
The model proved sufficient

talk about how hthe model would also alow the sonsor to be used for subjects with prosthesis and allow for better understanding of disabled persons.

\subsection{Captured and Processed Data}


The following is a graph of the accelerometer in the z-body frame against time.

From this graph it it the rythmic motion of running is easy to see. a spike of close to 4g seen at the moment of impact and a maximum acceleration of around 1 g as the subject reaches maximum height.
